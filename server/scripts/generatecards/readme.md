#Card Generator
The card generator script is designed to assist with development of new cards, and (over time) reduce maintenance effort by removing the need for individual implementations of cards with identical functionality. It also provides some useful outputs for analysis projects.

### Unimplemented features:
* Does not create poltergeist-friendly implementations of shard-like artifacts.
* Does not disable abilities that affect a card after it is destroyed if they leave the discard pile.
